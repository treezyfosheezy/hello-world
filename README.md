## About Me

>journeyman.
>
I am still trying to figure out if this is a microagression or not. I guess if I am struggling to decide, I have my answer!
## Some Facts
1. I am a musician at heart, but do not with to pursue a career of one (most of the time).
2. I love my fiancee more than there are stars in the sky.
3. I believe that kindness and communication are the most important things when it comes to living in this world.

## Why I am learning to code
-I want a career that is more lucrative in order to live the lifestyle I want for me and my family. 
-I want a career that is more fulfilling and in line with how I'd like to spend my time - creating and problem solving.
-I want a career that can lead me to be a part of a greater mission - whether that be working for a technology company that is working toward technology to better our future through the environment, or a company that is trying to serve the people.
# That's all for now. Thanks!
